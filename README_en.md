# Deep Learning Career Faq

I'm doing language research projects based on deep learning. Sometimes I'm asked "How can I be a deep learning researcher?" Every time I had such a question, I felt guilty because it was always hard to give an organized answer. So I decided to write my ideas here. Needless to say, these are just my opinions, so don't take them seriously if you don't agree. (But feel free to leave what you think on ISSUES!)

## Q. What is a deep learning player?
A. Deep learning players are people who participate in various activities like research or projects based on deep learning. Generally they can be classified as below. However, I'm not saying this division is absolute. Rather, it would be more natural to say that "I have preferences of <b>R</b>, <b>A</b>, <b>E</b>, and <b>D</b> in ratio of 2:5:2:1.” In this way, one can understand that personalities of deep learning players are not identical in the course of posing questions and thinking about their own identities.
 
* Deep learning <b><u>R</u></b>esearcher: Basically these people have an academic viewpoint on deep learning. They explore theories, models, and algorithms aiming for the innovation of the foundation level. Researchers in schools or research groups belong to this category. They want to contribute to the academic community by publishing papers.
 
* Deep learning <b><u>A</u></b>pplied researchers: They are more interested in services or products using deep learning than things under the hood. They aim to use deep learning efficiently to address problems in real fields such as computer vision, language, medicine, bio, and robotics. They regard both the value contribution and business to be equally important. <b>A</b> is different from <b>R</b> in that they deal with actual problems rather than research topics and also different from <b>E</b> in that they focus on solutions rather than execution or efficiency.
 
* Deep learning <b><u>E</u></b>ngineer: They have capabilities to create actual services or products using deep learning knowledge. They can create models and systems efficiently when they are given a description. <b>E</b> has excellent programming skills as well as comprehensive understanding of IT service.
 
* <b><u>D</u></b>omain expert: They define problems to be addressed based on professional knowledge about a domain and set directions of a project. Knowledge about a certain domain is essential in any real service. For example, if you don't understanding the nature of the fashion industry you won't know what kind of deep learning technique is actually important in the business sense. Although people expect that deep learning will bring state-of-the-art progress in the discovery of new medicine, it won't be possible without cooperation between deep learning researchers and systems biologists.
 
## Q. What capabilities should deep learning players have?
A. To answer this question briefly is not easy. Belows are some, not exaustive, of them. Note that it's usually not a good idea if you plan to be armed with all these things perfectly and then jump into the deep learning field. Remember that often it's more important to focus on your own strengths than trying to make up for your weaknesses too much.

 
### Basic knowledge
* Mathematics (linear algebra, calculus, probability, statistics, log, etc.): Mathematics is an essential tool for understanding and studying deep learning theoretically like other natural sciences. <b>R</b> requires in-depth knowledge more than undergraduate level not only in these areas shown on the left but also other fields. <b>A</b> or <b>E</b> can start with brushing up on their mathematics in high school. You may develop your math skills whenever you have to.
 
* Computer science (data structure, algorithm, etc.)/ Programming (Python, Java C, R, etc.): Particularly undergraduates should be familiar with basic computer science topics such as data structure or algorithm. They are also common topics in job interviews. Programming ability is essential for all players except for <b>D</b>. (If <b>D</b> can do programming, it will be wonderful though) Generally Python is considered as the basic language, but <b>E</b> may be required to be proficient in other languages as well.
 
* English (Reading >>> listening, writing, or speaking): 99 of 100 papers, blogs, articles, and lectures you will be facing when learning deep learning are written in English. You should start improving your English right away if you are searching non-English data due to the high pressure in English. Generally speaking, reading is the most important among the four skills. You should have basic knowledge of grammar and familiarize yourself with formal vocabulary in order to read deep learning papers. listening, writing, and speaking abilities are also required when you watch videos in English or attend conferences or communicate with foreign friends. Don't be obsessed by the idea that you must be like a native speaker. Rather, do step by step and you will get to the proper level to act as a deep learning player.

### Practical capabilities
* Deep learning knowledge: It is never easy to obtain deep knowledge about a certain science field. So isn't deep learning, which is dramatically developing. Many say they are often overwhelmed by a huge amount of information updated day by day. It's true, but let's keep in mind that fundamentals don't easily change. You need to take in new knowledge with a light heart after consolidating your fundamental knowledge through various roots such as [books](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Adaptive-Computation-Machine/dp/0262035618/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535600988&sr=1-1&keywords=deep+learning+ian+goodfellow), [MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) or Stanford courses. It is particularly important to understand terminology exactly and use them correctly. I recommend you check [this](http://www.wildml.com/deep-learning-glossary/) regularly and  self-check whether you can give accounts to other people with your own words.
* Use of deep learning tools (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.): Currently in most deep learning programming one of the three libraries shown on the left is used. The ability to handle one well is important. Which one should be learned among them remains controversial. What is more important is to pick up any of them and make it your own. TensorFlow version is frequently updated, so keep it in mind.
* Knowledge of other fields (search, natural language processing, linguistics, signal processing, biology, medicine, fashion, etc.): Deep learning likes end-to-end. Deep learning also pursues domain knowledge agnostic. Great. But still knowledge of relevant fields is important, I think. For example, knowledge about searching can be useful if you make a recommendation system. Linguistics or signal processing is needed for some language tasks. Medicine or biology is important in bio research. <b>D</b> should have professional knowledge of the domain they belong to. <b>R</b> and <b>A</b> need to focus on acquiring basic knowledge for communicating with others and understanding problems.
 
### Qualities
Personal qualities are as important as capabilities in deep learning projects.

* Problem solving: Ultimately deep learning is nothing but a tool for solving problems. In academic research you are to tackle a problem under strict academic settings, while in a production project you will address various realistic restrictions. You are required to understand the problem exactly and keep the rules of the game as a player. When it comes to the real scenario, perhaps you need to take many things like budget, resources, human power, time limits, etc. into account. Actually problems are always around us. Are you ready for them?
* Communication skill: I can say for sure. You can't do deep learning alone. You conduct assignment in groups. People have different preferences and use different languages (literally and figuratively). You should be able to convey your opinion clearly with words that others can understand.
* Intellectual curiosity: Deep learning opens it door to only those who have strong intellectual curiosity. You may be asked which papers you read for the last seven days in your job interview. 

## Q. I'm a high school student. What do I have to prepare to be a deep learning player?
A. You should study English and mathematics hard. It would be perfect if you can do programming. Go to the university and department you want. Majoring in computer science is a great idea, but not a must. I encourage you to consider a double major. If you are interested in language, study linguistics as a major. If you like bio, then choose biology or chemistry.

## Q. I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer science. I have no idea of deep learning. What should I prepare to become a deep learning player?
A. First, concentrate on your major. If you think you're super talented, do what you want. Otherwise, be devoted to your academic life. And check whether you have basic knowledge as explained above. If you are ready, start to study deep learning.

## Q. I'm undergraduate student. My major has nothing to do with computer science. Can I become a deep learning player?
A. Probably. If you have no experience in programming, learn Python first. Check whether you are comfortable with  structural thinking. If you think you are, try to build whatever you want using Python. This will take at least 6 months to 1 year. If you survive, jump into deep learning.
 
## Q. I'm undergraduate student. Is it okay to study deep learning alone?
A. You will be easily enervated. Meet many like-minded people online and offline. You should decide if you want to go to the graduate school, or get a job, or create your own company. Anyway, work as an intern in a deep learning company. You will be motivated and you can have your own portfolio. Plus, consider the following activities for your resume.

* Challenge [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). You can find various kinds of well defined problems from real domains. You can gain valuable experience in data science. People share their ideas and code with others there. In addition, if you luckily succeeding in getting to the top n, you win prize! Otherwise, you can write your challenge story on your resume. Explain the lessons you learned from it in your interview and advertise yourself as a serious researcher.
* Join Hackathon. 
* Do GitHub. Manage your projects on your github. These activities may have a couple of implications. You can display your programming abilities as well as your research interests. In addition, it shows you are a person who contributes to the open source community.
* Publish your short papers on arXiv. Try to choose a deep learning related topic for your school project. Revise your final paper to fit in arXiv and publish it on arXiv. You can practice writing a paper and your papers on arXiv will be a great source of your portfolio.

## Q. After completing basic study and then which part should I select?  
A. If you have a problem to be addressed in mind, do it. Otherwise, my answer is the same as shown above.

## Q. I'm an undergraduate student. Should I go to the graduate school to be a deep learning player?
A. You don't have to go to the graduate school if knowledge is what you want. Actually, many courses and curriculums by deep learning experts are publicly available. If you want to learn deep learning, I think simply it's better to learn from them. Grad school means much more than learning itself.  Read [Andrej Karpathy's great blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/). After all, if you have a clear reason other than learning, then pursue your degree.
  
## Q. I want to use a GPU, but it is very expensive. Should I buy one?
A. Yes!  A GPU card is a must-have. Don't save money. You will get more than 100 times rewards.

##   Q. I'm working at a manufacturing industry. My job has nothing to do with deep learning. Would it be good to study deep learning? 
 A. Absolutely. If you study deep learning, I'm sure you will have new opportunities. First, read other Q&A in this article and ask yourself how enthusiastic you are. Don't get deep into the theory of deep learning. Instead try to use deep learning knowledge to find real problems to solve in your field and define them in data science terms.
  
## Q. Most of my friends decided video or language as their main interests. However, I have no idea which domain I choose. I mean, I don't know which specific domain I choose and concentrate on. What's your opinion?
A. Do what you like. If you like it, there is a way for any other domain of this deep learning. Not to mention language, computer vision has so many unsolved problems. So you don't have to be worry about red ocean. But if you want me to suggest domains that are relatively uncovered, I recommend you take a look at bio and environment. You need background knowledge for both fields. That's why not so many people enter into those domains. But I think there are many opportunities in them.
  
## Q. Many papers on deep learning come out every day. I tried to read all of them, but I am so overwhelmed. I have no idea of what paper I should read and get flooded with similar ones. What should I do now?
A. The first you should do is to keep in mind that “I am not alone.” I am in the same shoes. Many people will do so. Honestly I don't know answer. Just don't miss important papers that many others talk about. Try to frequently meet other people, and attend seminars in order to keep you refreshed and not to miss the mainstream of research. Also, remember that we are in the age of long life expectancy and there are too many days to live and a long way for AI to move. Hang in there.
 
## Q. What should be prepared to study deep learning or create the business ecosystem?
A. Naturally the number of deep learning researchers should increase. But more business success should be achieved. To do so, more opportunities to make deep learning researchers and domain experts meet together should be provided. It is okay for domain experts to attend open seminars, but it would be far better to invite deep learning researchers to your companies. Ask for practical advice and talented researchers. Network is vital in this field. Deep learning researchers should frequently visit companies and listen to their voices. Answers always exits in fields.
